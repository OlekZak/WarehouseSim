# Warehouse Simulator with Unreal Engine

An arcade stlye warehouse simulator made with Unreal Engine 4.27.2. This game was made as a way of learning C++ through making my own game in a game engine I already know, Unreal Engine 4.27.2.

## Description

As a game developer, I have had quite a while to work with different versions Unreal Engine but I've never used C++ to make a game. Out of all of the versions, I felt most comfortable with UE4.27.2, making it my go-to version for learning C++. 

To not overload myself on C++, I have decided to make a game thats build on a hybrid of both C++ and UE Blueprint. This would make learning C++ in general less daughting of a task.
